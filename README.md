# The Black Pearl – KU Leuven Datathon 2025

Our team, **The Black Pearl**, consists of Michael Carlo, Giovanni Dettori, Fabrizio Sacco, Keith Atienza, and Seamus Conlon. We are participating in the KU Leuven Datathon, analyzing **World War I propaganda posters** using LLMs for historical interpretation, theme identification, sentiment analysis, and trend detection.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to **perform sentiment analysis and identify temporal trends** in World War I propaganda poster data using Large Language Models (LLMs). The dataset consists of **OCR-extracted text files** stored in the `data/` folder. We utilize both **local and cloud-based models** for analysis:
- **Local Inference**: Running LLMs locally using **Ollama**.
- **Cloud-Based Inference**: Using pre-trained models via the **Hugging Face API** or **OpenAI API** for **TinyTroupe** simulation.

## Workflow

All files marked as **EXTRA** below are located in the `src` folder. These files are **not part of the official Datathon results** but can be used to run alternative models or visualize specific data.  

### 1. **TinyTroupe – Counter-Propaganda Generation**
**'TinyTroupe.ipynb'** is a Jupyter Notebook simulation where **two AI agents engage in a conversation** about a given WWI propaganda poster.  
The discussion is designed to:
- Reveal **biases**, **rhetorical techniques**, and **persuasive strategies** in historical propaganda.
- Generate **counter-propaganda**, providing an **alternative perspective**.

### 2. **TinyTroupe2.ipynb – Placeholder for Further Development**
The discussion is designed to:
- Reveal **biases**, **rhetorical techniques**, and **persuasive strategies** in historical propaganda.
- Generate **counter-propaganda**, providing an **alternative perspective** using **more detailed interactions** .

### 3. **Data Handling – Preparing Texts for Analysis**
The `data_handler.py` script processes **OCR-extracted text files** and prepares them for analysis. Users can specify which texts to analyze, and the script structures the data accordingly.

### 4. **Data Visualization – Emotional & Thematic Comparison**
The `wordcloud.py` module visualizes **key themes** from both **original propaganda** and **AI-generated counter-propaganda**.  
Using frequency analysis, a **word cloud** highlights **dominant themes**, with **larger words** representing more prevalent topics.

**EXTRA:** The `visualization.py` module compares the **original propaganda** with the **AI-generated counter-propaganda**.  
Using sentiment and thematic analysis, different **emotions are represented as growing bubbles** in a visual comparison. The **size of each bubble** depends on the **dominance of specific emotions** in the texts.

The first image below shows the **word cloud** representation of thematic dominance in the texts.  
The second image illustrates how exposure to **counter-propaganda** influenced the AI agents' perspectives, shifting from **national pride** toward **empathy and reflection** on the human cost of war.

### 5. **EXTRA: Text Analysis – Sentiment & Theme Detection**
Located in `src/TextAnalysis/`, this component handles the core **text analysis**:
- **`HF_text_analysis.py`** – Uses the **Hugging Face API** for **sentiment analysis** and **topic modeling**.
- **`Ollama.py`** – Runs **LLMs locally** for **text interpretation** without cloud reliance.

## Project Setup

To get started with The Black Pearl's analysis of WWI propaganda posters, follow the steps below to set up the necessary tools and dependencies.

### 1. Setting Up Hugging Face API
We use Hugging Face's pre-trained models for text analysis. Follow these steps to create an API key:

1. **Register on Hugging Face**: Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and sign up for an account.
2. **Generate an API Key**:
   - Click on your profile icon in the top right corner.
   - Navigate to "Settings" > "Access Tokens."
   - Click "New Token," name it appropriately (e.g., `datathon-project`), and choose "Write" permissions.
   - Copy and save the API key securely.
3. **Store the API Key**:
   - Export it as an environment variable in your terminal power shell in vscode:
     ```bash
     $env:HF_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
     ```
   - Or store it in a `.env` file:
     ```
     HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

### 2. Installing and Running Ollama Locally
To analyze text files locally, we use [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) for running LLMs without requiring cloud-based inference.

#### **Installation**
1. **Download Ollama**:
   - MacOS: `brew install ollama`
   - Linux: Follow instructions at [Ollama Install](https://ollama.ai/docs)
   - Windows (WSL recommended): Set up a compatible environment following [Ollama's guide](https://ollama.ai/docs/windows)

2. **Install Required Models**:
   - Run the following command to install a model like `mistral`:
     ```bash
     ollama pull mistral
     ```
   - To see available models:
     ```bash
     ollama list
     ```

3. **Run a Model**:
   - Start a local instance with:
     ```bash
     ollama run mistral
     ```
   - Or interact with the model in a script:
     ```python
     import ollama
     response = ollama.chat(model='mistral', messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this text..."}])
     print(response['message'])
     ```

### 3. Cloning the Repository & Running the Project
1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Analysis**:
   - Using Ollama:
     ```bash
     python src/ollama_runner.py
     ```
   - Using Hugging Face API:
     ```bash
     python src/huggingface_runner.py
     ```

This setup ensures you have everything needed to analyze WWI propaganda texts efficiently. If you run into issues, check the official documentation for Hugging Face and Ollama or reach out to the team!
